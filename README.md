# Embedded Systems Portfolio

A curated portfolio of embedded systems projects demonstrating HAL driver development, RTOS-based design, desktop–embedded interaction, and IoT connectivity across AVR, PIC, and ARM
microcontrollers.

## Repository Structure

- `01-hal-driver-library/` – Reusable 8-bit HAL drivers (PIC, AVR)
- `02-smart-security-system/` – Embedded security & monitoring system (LPC2148)
- `03-desktop-hardware-dashboard/` – Python GUI + UART-controlled MCU backend
- `04-iot-sensor-logger/` – IoT data logging using ESP8266
- `05-rtos-task-management/` – RTOS task, mutex, and IPC demonstrations

> Each project is self-contained and documented individually.
