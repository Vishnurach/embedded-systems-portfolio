# Embedded Systems Portfolio

A curated portfolio of embedded systems projects demonstrating HAL driver development, RTOS-based design, desktop–embedded interaction, and IoT connectivity across AVR, PIC, and ARM microcontrollers.

## Repository Structure

- `01-pic16f876a-hal-driver-library/` – Reusable 8-bit HAL drivers
- `02-lpc2148-smart-security-system/` – Embedded security & monitoring system
- `03-lpc1768-real-time-dashboard/` – Python GUI + UART-controlled MCU backend
- `04-atmega128-rtos-task-management/` – RTOS task, mutex, and IPC demonstrations

> Each project is self-contained and documented individually.
